When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all 
your work local?

  I would want to use a remote repository when I want to share my work
  with others, or if I want to work on multiple computers.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	So that I don't pull changes that are irrelivant to me, and also to 
	save internet data and hard drive space.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would 
you use one instead of another?

	Forks would be used if I wanted to play around with some other people's
	project and put it on GitHub. Clones would be used if I only wanted to
	play around with other people's project locally and branches would be
	used to play around with a new feature.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the
remote stored locally?
	
	So that you won't have to do merges and pulls and pushs... all that,
	and just edit that repository directly.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier,
and what would be harder?
	
	If I didn't collaborate using Git or GitHub, alot of things are going
	to be messy, with patches all over the place. Sorting the situation
	out would be hard. However, it is easier by the fact that I don't have
	to do all this "git" stuff.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than 
directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

	Wnen making changes in a separate branch, it's easy to iron out the
	kinks and then get the branch merged with master. Making changes
	directly in master means that you don't get to have that.
