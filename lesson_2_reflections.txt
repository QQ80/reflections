What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    Git starts tracking the changes that you make in the directory "git
    init" is ran. This allows us to commit changes we make later on.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area "stages" files that would be really commited, and
	takes files from the working directory. That makes it so that commits
	can be clearly seen from "git status", and you can see exactly what you
	commit and share in the public.
